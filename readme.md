# Laravel Laundry Management System.
# MCA Sem 5 Laravel mini project for Laravel based Laundry Management System Project.

Time was not on my side to do most of the things I usually do in project but if I get the time I will keep adding things,
but for now this is to get some 30 marks only.

This concept of this application is for a laundry service to manage their daily activities in terms of keeping customer records and some basic accounts, so therefore, it is an enterprise system for specific
users in the company but not for everyone to visit the website and register to be a member. It does not also include automating the washing machines or any sort of automations in the company.


I have added a PPT file and the databse file in a folder called "You Need" in the project directory to give you an idea of the interface.

# How to get in.
1. After download keep it in your xammp/htdocs directory or folder

2. The database file is named "lms_laravel_project.sql" so import it to your phpmyadmin, but if you have password for your database connection then you need to make that changes in the .env file in the project directory.

3. Fire up your xampp server or use the local server that laravel (php artisan serve) provides to launch the applcations

Note:
	I use macOS to developed this project so if you are using windows then you get to make it work on your own. But linux users may not have difficulties.

Login as Admin: username: admin@mycota.com password: 00mohamed

In the database/UsersTableSeeder you can add more users and roles or run the faker cmd to fake more randomly generated users.

# Important to note

This work was done by me except some help I got on how to integrate the User Auth in laravel so that I don't spend time creating my own user authecations, so I added more columns to the user table and created the user roles so that one user can have more roles.

Don't forget to SAY THANKS if you like this work as you know coding is not an easy job for the non-persistant and inpatients one and feel free to copy and use it as your project work if you need and you can contact me to get some help, but hey make some changes to suit your needs.

# Persist and it shall Work.
